title: Upgrading to Yarn v3 & PNP
---

Set the version to 'stable'

`yarn set verion stable`

Run `yarn` so it upgrades the lockfiles, once upgraded you can remove the old `.yarnrc` file, while in the new `.yarnrc.yml` make sure `nodeLinker: node-modules` exist as roblox-ts does **not** support PNP.

If you opened the project in vscode you should see it error out as typescript panics, to fix this you have to add [sdks](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks).

`yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks` 

Once added you also need to fix types as the project no longer use `node-modules`. Go to `tsconfig.json` and comment out or remove

`"typeRoots": ["packages/@rbxts"],`

And add a new file inside `src/` named `rbxts-env.d.ts` then add this on the file

`/// <reference types="@rbxts/types" />`

This will re-add typings into the workspace

You may also add [plugins](https://yarnpkg.com/features/plugins/) such as [upgrade-interactive](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/upgrade-interactive) to easily upgrade dependencies
